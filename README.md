## Getting the page up

From the `checkout/` directory, execute this line in your terminal:

```
Point your browser to [localhost:3000](https://localhost:3000) or alternatively go to [my github](http://lukmanism.github.io/demos/checkout/#/users/1).

Test cases available at your [localhost](http://localhost:3000/app/tests/), or [here.](http://lukmanism.github.io/demos/checkout/app/tests/)

## Checking out the source

All codework are available from `checkout/app/*` directories, except for `checkout/app/scripts/vendors`. Test cases can be view from `checkout/app/tests/spec/test.js`.

## Important Notice

Please make sure your browser's adblock deactivated. At some point the newer version of requirejs(as of this demo's version) stops rendering the page without any error prompted.

## Brief info on the project

I've approached the project as a Frontend Developer role, heavy on the frontend technologies(BackboneJS, UnderscoreJs, Bootstrap, jQuery & RequireJS) & the UX, and a very minor UI work. I've designed the collections & models(tables & relations) too, to suit the database/backend skillset for your review, ideally, this was coming from a webservice. The basic test cases are made to match your `Example Scenarios`, with a lil extra test for my requirements. Altho, I must admit that there are more test cases and development work to be done just to complete the tip of *POC's* stage. With that, I'll leave you with the best possible work within your requirements and required timeframe. Let me know if there's any.

Thank you.
