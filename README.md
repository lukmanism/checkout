## Getting the page up

From the `checkout/` directory, execute this line from your terminal:

node index.js
```
Point your browser to [localhost:3000](https://localhost:3000) or alternatively go to [my github](http://lukmanism.github.io/demos/checkout/#/users/1).

Test cases available at your [localhost](http://localhost:3000/app/tests/), or [here.](http://lukmanism.github.io/demos/checkout/app/tests/)

## Checking out the source

All codework are available from `checkout/app/*` directories, except for `checkout/app/scripts/vendors`. Test cases can be view from `checkout/app/tests/spec/test.js`.

## Important Notice

Please make sure your browser's adblock deactivated. At some point the newer version of requirejs(as of this demo's version) stops rendering the page without any error prompted.
